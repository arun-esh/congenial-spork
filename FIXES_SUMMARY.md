# Fixes Summary - AppPilot Service Management Dashboard

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Port Detection Running on Every Favorite Toggle** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: When toggling favorites, the app was calling `fetchServicesAndFavorites()` which re-fetched all services and ran port detection for every service.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `toggleFavorite()` function to update state locally without API calls
- Only refresh services when actually needed (service actions, manual refresh)
- Port detection now only runs for active services during initial load

**Files Modified**: `src/app/page.tsx`

### 2. **Port Detection Logic Bugs** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: 
- Getting "To:" as a service name
- Parsing issues with systemctl output
- Inefficient port detection for all services

**Solution**:
- Created `src/lib/service-config.ts` with proper service filtering
- Added validation to skip invalid service names
- Only detect ports for active services
- Better error handling and logging

**Files Modified**: `src/app/api/services/route.ts`, `src/lib/service-config.ts`

### 3. **Sudoers Syntax Errors** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: 
```
/etc/sudoers.d/service-manager:2:20: syntax error
appserver ALL=(ALL)
                   ^
```

**Solution**:
- Fixed sudoers syntax in `sudoers-config.txt`
- Created `setup-services.sh` script for easy configuration
- Proper format: `username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: command`
- Limited permissions to specific services only

**Files Modified**: `sudoers-config.txt`, `setup-services.sh`

### 4. **Service Filtering and Management** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: 
- All system services were being displayed
- No focus on custom services like `mcp-server`
- Poor performance with hundreds of system services

**Solution**:
- Added `CUSTOM_SERVICES` array for priority services
- Added `SYSTEM_SERVICES` array to exclude system services
- Smart filtering logic in `shouldIncludeService()`
- Easy configuration management

## New Features Added

### 1. **Service Configuration Management**
- Centralized service configuration in `src/lib/service-config.ts`
- Easy to add/remove custom services
- Configurable system service exclusions

### 2. **Setup Script**
- `setup-services.sh` for easy sudoers configuration
- Interactive setup process
- Automatic permission testing

### 3. **Performance Improvements**
- Port detection only for active services
- Local state updates for favorites
- Reduced API calls

## How to Use

### 1. **Setup Sudo Permissions**
```bash
sudo ./setup-services.sh
```
This will:
- Configure sudo permissions for your user
- Set up access to `mcp-server` and `mcp-service`
- Test the configuration

### 2. **Add Custom Services**
Edit `src/lib/service-config.ts`:
```typescript
CUSTOM_SERVICES: [
  'mcp-server',
  'mcp-service', 
  'your-custom-service',
  // Add more here
]
```

### 3. **Run the Application**
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Configuration Files

### `src/lib/service-config.ts`
- **CUSTOM_SERVICES**: Services that should always be included
- **SYSTEM_SERVICES**: Services that should be excluded
- **SYSTEM_PATTERNS**: Regex patterns for system services

### `sudoers-config.txt`
- Template for sudo permissions
- Specific commands allowed for each service
- Security-focused configuration

### `setup-services.sh`
- Automated setup script
- Interactive configuration
- Permission testing

## Security Improvements

1. **Limited Sudo Access**: Only specific systemctl commands for specific services
2. **No Wildcard Permissions**: Explicit service names only
3. **Read-only Commands**: Separate permissions for listing vs. controlling
4. **User Isolation**: Dedicated user with minimal required permissions

## Performance Improvements

1. **Selective Port Detection**: Only for active services
2. **Local State Updates**: No unnecessary API calls
3. **Smart Filtering**: Exclude system services early
4. **Caching**: Favorites stored locally

## Testing

The application now:
- ✅ Only shows relevant services (custom + non-system)
- ✅ Doesn't run port detection on favorite toggles
- ✅ Has proper sudo permissions configuration
- ✅ Focuses on your custom services like `mcp-server`
- ✅ Has much better performance and UI

## Next Steps

1. Run `sudo ./setup-services.sh` to configure permissions
2. Start the application with `npm run dev`
3. Test service management with `mcp-server`
4. Add more custom services to the configuration as needed
